# Archi

An autonomous AI agent that runs on your machine, communicates via Discord, and works independently in the background. Archi uses Grok 4.1 Fast (Reasoning) via xAI direct as the default model, with Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview via OpenRouter as the automatic escalation tier. Claude Haiku 4.5 handles computer use tasks. Multiple providers supported (xAI, OpenRouter, Anthropic, DeepSeek, OpenAI, Mistral) with runtime switching via Discord.

It operates in two modes: **chat mode** for responding to Discord messages, and **dream mode** for autonomous background work when idle — pursuing goals, researching topics, and learning from its actions.

## Features

- **Multi-provider inference** — Default: OpenRouter (x-ai/grok-4.1-fast at ~$0.52-1.04/day). Optional: route directly to xAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, etc. by adding API keys. Switchable at runtime via Discord ("switch to deepseek", "switch to grok direct", etc.).
- **Auto-escalation for computer use** — Click, screenshot, and vision tasks automatically switch to Claude Haiku, then revert when done.
- **Dream cycles** — Autonomous background processing when idle 15+ minutes (adaptive: 5 min–2 hr): goal decomposition, research, file creation, self-review, brainstorming, and cross-goal synthesis
- **Multi-step reasoning** — PlanExecutor engine handles research, analysis, and multi-part requests with crash recovery and self-verification
- **Goal system** — Create goals via chat or commands; Archi decomposes them into tasks and executes autonomously
- **Discord interface** — DM or @mention with live progress updates during multi-step tasks
- **Desktop & browser automation** — pyautogui mouse/keyboard/screenshot + Playwright web navigation
- **Three-tier memory** — Short-term (in-memory), working (SQLite), long-term (LanceDB vectors with semantic deduplication)
- **MCP tool layer** — Model Context Protocol client connects to stdio-based tool servers (local + GitHub); add new servers in `config/mcp_servers.yaml` with no code changes
- **Safety controls** — Protected files, blocked commands, budget enforcement, workspace isolation, git-backed rollback
- **Image generation** — Local SDXL text-to-image (optional)
- **Free web search** — DuckDuckGo search, no API key needed
- **Learning system** — Records experiences, extracts patterns, generates improvement suggestions
- **Self-extending skills** — Say "learn how to do X" and Archi creates a reusable skill module. Skills are AST-validated Python in `data/skills/`, auto-suggested from repeated patterns during dream cycles, and invokable by PlanExecutor like any other action. Manage via `/skill list`, `/skill create`, `/skill info`.
- **Scheduled tasks** — Cron-based recurring tasks with natural language scheduling ("remind me to stretch every day at 4:15"). Engagement tracking auto-retires ignored notifications. Manage via `/schedule` or `/reminders`.
- **Personality & growth** — Archi develops over time: daily journal for continuity, evolving opinions/preferences/interests (worldview), behavioral rules from repeated outcomes, taste development from task performance, and weekly self-reflection with meta-cognition.
- **Curiosity & projects** — ~20% of dream cycles spent exploring topics Archi is genuinely interested in. High-curiosity interests can evolve into persistent personal projects tracked across sessions.
- **Social awareness** — Detects user mood from message tone and adjusts behavior accordingly. Proactively shares when opinions change significantly ("I changed my mind about...").

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10–3.12 (3.13+ not yet supported by ML dependencies)
- 16GB+ RAM recommended
- NVIDIA GPU optional (for local SDXL image generation)
- Windows (primary target) or Linux

### 1. Clone and set up

```bash
git clone https://github.com/koorbmeh/Archi.git
cd Archi
```

**Guided setup (recommended):** Run the installer, which walks you through everything:

```bash
python scripts/install.py setup
```

This handles Python version check, venv creation, dependency installation, config file setup, API key entry, optional features (voice, image gen), and a connectivity check. Run `python scripts/install.py --check` to verify an existing setup without changing anything.

If no `.env` file exists, the installer will auto-suggest the guided setup when run without arguments (`python scripts/install.py`).

**Manual setup:** If you prefer to do it yourself:

```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
py -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\pip.exe install -r requirements.txt

# Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or just the deps: `python scripts/install.py deps`

### 2. Configure environment

If you used `install.py setup`, this is already done. Otherwise:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings
```

**Required:** `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` — get one at [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys). Powers all inference (default model: Grok 4.1 Fast).

**Optional but recommended:**
- `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` — for Discord interface (the only active interface)
- `XAI_API_KEY` — for direct xAI routing (cheaper, faster for Grok models)
- `CUDA_PATH` — CUDA toolkit root if not auto-detected (only needed for SDXL image generation)

### 3. Configure identity

If you used `install.py setup`, config templates are already copied. Otherwise:

```bash
cp config/archi_identity.example.yaml config/archi_identity.yaml
cp config/prime_directive.example.txt config/prime_directive.txt
cp config/mcp_servers.example.yaml config/mcp_servers.yaml
```

Edit `archi_identity.yaml` to set Archi's name, role, focus areas, and proactive tasks. Edit `prime_directive.txt` with your operational guidelines. These shape how Archi behaves and what it works on autonomously. The MCP server config works out of the box but can be extended with additional servers.

**Build your profile (optional):** Run `python scripts/profile_setup.py` to answer a short interview about your preferences, schedule, and interests. This seeds `user_model.json` and `archi_identity.yaml` so Archi knows you from day one instead of learning everything from scratch. Run `python scripts/profile_setup.py --show` to view your current profile.

### 4. Run

```bash
# Windows
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\start.py

# Linux
python scripts/start.py
```

This starts the full service: agent loop, dream cycle monitoring, and Discord bot (if configured).

## Configuration

### .env

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. Key settings:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Yes | OpenRouter API key (default provider for all inference) |
| `OPENROUTER_MODEL` | No | API model override (default: `x-ai/grok-4.1-fast` in code) |
| `XAI_API_KEY` | No | xAI direct API key ("switch to grok direct") |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | No | Anthropic direct API key ("switch to claude direct") |
| `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` | No | DeepSeek direct API key ("switch to deepseek direct") |
| `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` | No | Discord bot token |
| `CUDA_PATH` | No | CUDA toolkit root (auto-detected on Windows, only for SDXL) |
| `ARCHI_ROOT` | No | Base path for logs, data, workspace (default: repo root) |
| `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` | No | GitHub PAT for MCP GitHub server (repo access, issues, PRs) |
| `DAILY_BUDGET_USD` | No | Override daily budget (default: from rules.yaml) |

### config/rules.yaml

Safety and operational rules: budget limits ($5/day, $100/month — typical usage ~$0.52-1.04/day with Grok), protected files, blocked commands, risk levels for different actions.

### config/archi_identity.yaml

Archi's personality, focus areas, and proactive task definitions. Drives what Archi works on during dream cycles.

### config/mcp_servers.yaml

MCP (Model Context Protocol) server definitions. Each entry specifies a stdio-based subprocess server that Archi connects to as a client. Servers start on first tool call and stop after an idle timeout. The default config includes a local server (wrapping Archi's built-in tools) and a GitHub server (issues, PRs, repo access). Add new servers here — no code changes required.

### config/heartbeat.yaml

Dream cycle timing and adaptive scheduling. Base idle interval: 900s (15 min), doubles after unproductive cycles (max 7200s / 2 hr), resets on user activity or productive work. Max parallel tasks per wave: 3. Night mode (11PM–6AM) suppresses notifications.

### config/skills.yaml

Self-extending skill system settings. Master enable/disable, skill directory (`data/skills`), auto-suggest toggle, confidence threshold, blocked imports list, execution timeout (30s), max concurrent skills (3).

## Usage

### Discord Bot

DM the bot or @mention it in a channel.

**Setup:**
1. Create a bot at [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Under **Bot → Privileged Gateway Intents**, enable: **Message Content Intent**
3. Copy the bot token → add `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_token` to `.env`
4. Under **OAuth2 → URL Generator**: select **bot** scope, then these permissions: **Send Messages**, **Embed Links**, **Attach Files**, **Read Message History**
5. Open the generated URL to invite the bot to your server
6. Start Archi — the Discord bot launches automatically

**Commands:** `/goal <description>`, `/goals`, `/status`, `/cost`, `/test`, `/skill list`, `/skill create <desc>`, `/skill info <name>`, `/help`

You can also chat naturally, give multi-step tasks ("Research the best thermal paste and write a report"), request files ("Create a Python script that..."), switch models on the fly ("switch to deepseek", "use claude for this task"), and receive notifications from dream cycles.

## How It Works

### Chat Mode

Messages flow through a v2 pipeline (`message_handler.py` → `intent_classifier.py` → `action_dispatcher.py` → `response_builder.py`):

1. **Fast paths** (no model call, $0): greetings, time questions, slash commands
2. **Multi-step routing**: research, analysis, and multi-part requests go to PlanExecutor (up to 12 steps in chat, 25 for coding)
3. **Model intent classification**: everything else gets a single API call to determine action

Multi-step tasks show live progress in Discord ("Step 3/12: Searching...").

### Dream Mode

After 15 minutes of inactivity (adaptive: 5 min–2 hr based on productivity), Archi enters a dream cycle with phases: morning report → brainstorming → task execution → history review → future planning → synthesis. Each cycle is capped at 10 minutes and $0.50 in API costs. Dream cycles are interruptible — any user activity stops the cycle immediately.

### Goal System

Goals are created via chat, commands, or autonomously during dream cycles. Each goal is decomposed into 2-4 tasks, then executed through PlanExecutor. PlanExecutor supports web search, webpage fetching, file operations, Python execution, shell commands, and a "think" action for reasoning steps. It has crash recovery (state saved after each step) and self-verification (reads back created files, rates quality 1-10).

### Model Routing

```
Request arrives
  ├─ Cache hit? → return cached ($0)
  └─ Active provider's API (default: OpenRouter → x-ai/grok-4.1-fast)
      └─ User can switch models and providers at runtime via Discord
```

Default model: Grok 4.1 Fast (Reasoning) via xAI direct. Auto-escalation to Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview via OpenRouter on QA rejection retries. Computer use tasks auto-escalate to Claude Haiku 4.5. Per-provider circuit breakers with fallback chain. Typical daily cost: ~$0.52-1.04 with active dream cycles. Add API keys for additional providers and switch at runtime via Discord ("switch to deepseek", "use claude for this task", etc.).

## Safety

- **Protected files** — core system files (plan_executor.py, safety_controller.py, rules.yaml, etc.) cannot be modified by autonomous actions
- **Blocked commands** — rm -rf, format, shutdown, reboot, fork bombs, registry edits, etc.
- **Budget enforcement** — hard stop at daily/monthly API cost limits
- **Workspace isolation** — file operations restricted to the workspace directory
- **Git safety** — automatic checkpoints before source modifications, syntax check after, rollback on failure
- **Risk levels** — actions classified L1 (low) through L4 (critical) with different authorization requirements

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose | Examples |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `install.py` | Guided setup, deps, voice, imagegen, CUDA, auto-start | `scripts/install.py setup`, `--check` |
| `profile_setup.py` | Build user profile (preferences, schedule, interests) | `scripts/profile_setup.py`, `--show` |
| `start.py` | Launch: service, discord, watchdog (offers profile setup on first run) | `scripts/start.py` |
| `fix.py` | Diagnose, test, clean caches, repair state | `scripts/fix.py diagnose` |
| `stop.py` | Stop processes, restart | `scripts/stop.py restart` |
| `reset.py` | Factory reset: clears runtime state, preserves config/workspace | `scripts/reset.py` |

### start.py modes

| Mode | What it runs |
|------|-------------|
| `service` | Agent loop + Discord bot (default) |
| `discord` | Discord bot only |
| `watchdog` | Service with auto-restart on crash |

### Windows auto-start

Auto-start uses two layers so Archi runs even without user login:

1. **Task Scheduler** (`startup_archi_headless.bat`): Starts Archi at boot under your user account, headless (output to `logs/startup.log`). Works even when you're not home.
2. **Startup folder** (`startup_archi_monitor.bat`): On login, opens a visible terminal that tails the log if Archi is already running, or starts Archi directly if it isn't.

Run `python scripts/install.py autostart` to configure both layers. Task Scheduler may require an elevated prompt; the Startup folder layer works without admin.

## Deployment

### Linux (systemd)

Create a service file at `/etc/systemd/system/archi.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Archi AI Agent
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=your_user
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/Archi
ExecStart=/path/to/Archi/venv/bin/python scripts/start.py
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```bash
# Edit paths in archi.service, then:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable archi
sudo systemctl start archi
```

### Windows (Task Scheduler + Startup folder)

```powershell
python scripts/install.py autostart
```

Sets up both layers: Task Scheduler (headless at boot) + Startup folder (visible monitor on login). To remove both: run the same command and choose "Remove".

### Security notes

- Store API keys in `.env` (not committed to git via whitelist-based .gitignore)
- Discord bot token should be kept secret — never commit it to version control

## Troubleshooting

**Run diagnostics:** `python scripts/fix.py diagnose` — checks environment, models, CUDA, API keys, ports, and system health.

**Run tests:** `python scripts/fix.py test` or `python -m pytest tests/ -v`

### Common issues

**Archi won't start:** Check dependencies (`scripts/install.py deps`) and verify your `.env` has `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` set.

**CUDA errors:** Only relevant if using SDXL image generation. Run `scripts/fix.py diagnose` for diagnostics.

**Budget exceeded:** Check spend with `scripts/fix.py diagnose` or `/cost` in Discord. Increase limits in `config/rules.yaml` or clear with `scripts/reset.py`.

### Logs

| Log | Location | Contents |
|-----|----------|----------|
| Conversations | `logs/conversations.jsonl` | User↔Archi exchanges with timestamp, source, action, cost |
| Chat trace | `logs/chat_trace.log` | Chat flow: intent parsing, model selection, routing |
| Daily actions | `logs/actions/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` | Per-day action log |
| Dream log | `data/dream_log.jsonl` | Dream cycle summaries |
| Goal state | `data/goals_state.json` | Goals and tasks with full lifecycle |

## Development

### Running tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v              # all tests
python -m pytest tests/unit/ -v         # unit tests only
python -m pytest tests/ -k router -v    # specific tests by keyword
```

### Adding tools

There are two ways to add tools:

**MCP server (no code changes):** Add an entry to `config/mcp_servers.yaml` with the server command, args, and env. Archi discovers the server's tools at startup and routes calls through MCP. Good for integrating external services (GitHub, databases, APIs).

**Direct tool:** Create a new tool class in `src/tools/` and register it in `tool_registry.py`. Tools are wrapped with circuit breakers for resilience. The local MCP server (`local_mcp_server.py`) automatically exposes registered tools over MCP as well.

### Adding models or providers

Model aliases, provider definitions, and pricing are all in `src/models/providers.py`. To add a new provider: add an entry to `PROVIDERS` (base_url, api_key_env, default_model), add aliases to `MODEL_ALIASES`, add pricing to `MODEL_PRICING`, and add the API key placeholder to `.env.example`. Switch at runtime via Discord ("switch to grok direct", "switch to deepseek", etc.).
